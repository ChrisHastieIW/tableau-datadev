# Tableau DataDev Server-Side Client

This is the server-side client for my personal Tableau DataDev journey.

## Web Server Install Guide

- Install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/)
- Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

Install the dependencies into the node_modules folder:
```sh
$ yarn install
```

Install http-server using npm:
```sh
$ npm install http-server
```

Start the http-server using npm:
```sh
$ npm start
```

## Credits

This project is mainly the result of my own work, however like all Tableau projects some credit should of course go to the wider Tableau community due to the great resources available online and the supportive #datadev group.
