# Tableau DataDev

This is a playground for my personal Tableau #DataDev journey.

## Tableau DataDev Bingo
One of my goals with this git repo is to complete the [Tableau DataDev Bingo](https://www.tableau.com/developer/mini-challenges) challenge.

## Web Server Install Guide

- Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Once installed, clone this repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ChrisHastieIW/tableau-datadev.git
```

Install the dependencies into the `public/lib` folder:
```sh
$ yarn install
```

### Web Server Hosting
This can either be hosted on an existing webserver or stood up on its own. To stand it up on its own, the following additional steps are required:

- Install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/)

Install http-server:
```sh
$ npm install http-server
```

Start the http-server using npm:
```sh
$ npm start
```

## Credits

This project is mainly the result of my own work, however like all Tableau projects some credit should of course go to the wider Tableau community due to the great resources available online and the supportive #datadev group.
